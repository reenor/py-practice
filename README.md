# Setup

## GCC installation

Python install will require a GCC installation, and Xcode includes command line development tools such as gcc and friends, so we need to install Xcode as follows:

```
xcode-select --install
```

## Homebrew installation

A package manager is missing in MacOS unlike in Linux. Homebrew fills this void.

To install Homebrew, run the following command:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## pyenv installation

This tool lets us switch easily between multiple versions of Python in our machine.
To install it, Homebrew

```
brew install pyenv
```
