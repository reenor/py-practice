# Write a Python function that takes a sequence of numbers and 
# determines if all the numbers are different from each other 
# (that is, they are distinct).

# Example:
# Input: arr[] = {5, 7, 1, 2}
# All the numbers are distinct
# Input: arr[] = {5, 7, 1, 2, 1}
# All the numbers are not distinct because there are 2 numbers that have the same value {1, 1}
